## Overview

This repo includes scripts for profiling memory usage and performance in Python.

## What is Memory Profiling?

Memory profiling is the process of analyzing a program to understand its memory consumption patterns. This involves tracking how much memory your application uses and identifying memory-intensive parts of your code.

### Why Use Memory Profiling?

1. **Optimize Memory Usage**: Memory profiling helps identify memory leaks and inefficient memory usage, which can lead to improved performance and reduced memory consumption.
2. **Enhance Performance**: By understanding which parts of your code are using the most memory, you can refactor or optimize those areas to make your application more efficient.
3. **Resource Management**: For applications running on systems with limited resources, efficient memory usage is critical to maintaining stability and performance.


## What is Performance Profiling?

Performance profiling is the process of analyzing a program to determine its execution time and identify bottlenecks. This involves measuring how long different parts of your code take to execute.

### Why Use Performance Profiling?

1. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Performance profiling helps pinpoint parts of your code that are slow or inefficient, allowing you to focus optimization efforts where they are needed most.
2. **Improve Efficiency**: By understanding execution times, you can make informed decisions about code improvements to enhance overall performance.
3. **Benchmarking**: Profiling provides benchmarks that help you measure the impact of optimizations and compare different approaches.


### Files

- `memory_profiler_example.py`: Demonstrates how to use the `memory_profiler` library to track memory usage of a Python function.
- `performance_profiling.py`: Uses the `cProfile` module to profile the execution time of a Python function.


### Setup

To use these profiling scripts, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install memory_profiler
```
