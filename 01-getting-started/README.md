## Introduction

 In this section, we'll cover how to set up Python and write your first simple program.

## Setting Up Python

To start programming in Python, you need to have Python installed on your computer. Follow these steps to set up Python:

### 1. **Download Python**

- **Windows/MacOS/Linux**: Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version of Python.
- Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system.

### 2. **Install Python**

- **Windows**:
  - Run the downloaded installer.
  - Make sure to check the box **"Add Python to PATH"** before clicking **"Install Now"**.
  - Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

- **MacOS**:
  - Open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the instructions to install Python.

- **Linux**:
  - You can usually install Python using your distribution's package manager. For example:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3
    ```

### 3. **Verify Installation**

To check if Python is installed correctly, open a terminal (or command prompt) and run:
```bash
python --version
```

or
```bash
python3 --version
```


### 4. **Installing a Code Editor**

-While you can use any text editor to write Python code, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a code editor can enhance your productivity. Here are some popular choices:

## Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

Download and install from the official website.
