We will explore four fundamental data structures available in Python: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Understanding these data structures is essential for effective data management and manipulation in Python programming.

## 1. Lists

Lists are ordered collections that can hold multiple items of various types. They are mutable, meaning you can change their contents after they are created.

### Features
- **Ordered**: Items have a defined order and maintain that order.
- **Mutable**: You can add, remove, or modify items.
- **Indexed**: Items are accessed by their index, starting from 0.

## 2. Tuples

Tuples are ordered collections similar to lists but are immutable, which means once they are created, their contents cannot be changed.

### Features
- **Ordered**: Items have a defined order.
- **Immutable**:We cannot add, modify, or remove items after creation.
- **Indexed**: Items are accessed by their index, starting from 0.

## 3. Dictionaries

Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and is used to access the corresponding value.

### Features
- **Unordered**: Items do not maintain a specific order.
- **Mutable**: You can add, modify, or remove key-value pairs.
- **Key-Value Pair**: Each item consists of a key and a corresponding value.


## 4. Sets

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful for operations such as membership testing, eliminating duplicates, and performing set operations.

### Features
- **Unordered**: Items do not maintain any specific order.
- **Mutable**: You can add or remove items, but items must be unique.
- **Unique Elements**: Duplicate elements are automatically removed.
