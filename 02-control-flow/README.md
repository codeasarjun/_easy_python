# Control Flow in Python

## Introduction

In this section, we will explore the control flow mechanisms in Python, including conditional statements and loops. 

## 1. Condition
 In Python, we use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to implement conditional logic.

## 2. Control Flow
    Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
