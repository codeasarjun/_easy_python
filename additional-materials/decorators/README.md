## What is a Decorator?

A decorator is a special type of function that takes another function as an argument and extends or alters its behavior. This is achieved by defining a wrapper function inside the decorator that wraps around the original function. Decorators are commonly used for:

- **Logging:** Automatically log function calls, arguments, and results.
- **Timing:** Measure the execution time of functions.
- **Authentication:** Restrict access to functions based on user credentials.
- **Caching:** Store and retrieve results of expensive function calls to improve performance.
- **Rate Limiting:** Control how frequently a function can be called.

## Why Use Decorators?

Decorators offer several benefits:

- **Code Reusability:** Define functionality once and apply it to multiple functions or methods.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep the core logic of functions separate from cross-cutting concerns like logging or authentication.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to modify or extend functionality without changing the original function code.
- **Readability:** Enhances the readability and organization of your code.

## File Descriptions

### `decorators_example.py`

This file contains various decorator implementations.

- **`log_function_call`**: Logs details of function calls, including arguments and results.
- **`timing_decorator`**: Measures and prints the execution time of functions.
- **`requires_authentication`**: Restricts access to functions based on user authentication status.
- **`cache_results`**: Caches function results to improve performance.
- **`rate_limit`**: Limits the frequency of function calls to prevent rate limiting issues.


## dec_call_functions.py

This file contains functions that utilize the decorators from `decorators_example.py`. It demonstrates how to apply various decorators to functions to enhance their functionality.

- **add:** A simple function to add two numbers, with logging applied.
- **compute_square:** Computes the square of numbers up to `n`, with timing applied.
- **view_profile:** Displays a user profile if authenticated, with authentication applied.
- **fibonacci:** Computes the Fibonacci sequence, with result caching applied.
- **fetch_data:** Retrieves data with rate limiting applied.
