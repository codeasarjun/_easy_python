## Overview
OOP helps in organizing code by grouping related data and functionality into classes and objects.

## Files

### 1. `classes_objects.py`

**Purpose**: Shows the basics of creating classes and objects.

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (e.g., `Car`).
- **Object**: An instance of a class (e.g., `my_car`).
- **Attributes**: Characteristics of an object (e.g., `make`, `model`).
- **Methods**: Functions defined inside a class (e.g., `display_info`).

### 2. `inheritance.py`

**Purpose**: Demonstrates how to use inheritance to extend classes.

- **Inheritance**: A way to create a new class from an existing class (e.g., `ElectricCar` inherits from `Vehicle`).
- **Subclass**: The new class that inherits (e.g., `ElectricCar`).
- **Superclass**: The class being inherited from (e.g., `Vehicle`).

### 3. `polymorphism_encapsulation.py`

**Purpose**: Covers polymorphism and encapsulation.

- **Polymorphism**: Allows different classes to be treated through a common interface (e.g., `Shape` class with `area` method).
- **Encapsulation**: Hides internal data and only exposes necessary parts (e.g., using private attributes in `Rectangle`).

### 4. `special_methods.py`

**Purpose**: Shows how to use special (magic) methods in Python.

- **Special Methods**: Methods with double underscores (e.g., `__add__`, `__eq__`).
- **Usage**: Define how objects behave with built-in operations (e.g., addition, comparison).
